##A comprehensive analysis of the niche space estimates  

###Step 1. Data
Load in species-level list data.
Load in rii data.
Calculate a mean rii, se of rii, record the year associated with rii estimate.

###Step 2. Categorize
Assign each species shrub, open, or neutral association with foundation species.
Filter out other dominants as well?
Address year issues - ie wet-dry turnover when a species was sampled in more than one year? Classify as switcher?

###Step 3. Estimate niche breadth  
For filtered and remaining species with rii-driven classifications, scrape gbif, run maxent, and consider null model for geographics.
